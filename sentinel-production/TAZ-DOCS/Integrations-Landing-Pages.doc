- Feed health & coverage: Monitor Cyren feed ingestion (latency, volume) to ensure continuous protection.
- Faster investigation: Pivot from Sentinel alerts to Cyren intel context (reputation, category, geography, etc.).
- Improved blocking decisions: Use Cyren reputation to drive custom blocking rules and policies.

Key Features / Value Points
- Single solution deployment: Data connector, custom table, analytics, and workbook are deployed as one Sentinel solution.
- Multiple analytic rules: For high‑risk indicators and feed availability/health.
- Rich workbook: Out‑of‑the‑box dashboard for pipeline health and indicator insights.
- Flexible integration: Designed to plug into existing Sentinel analytics and SOAR playbooks.

Installation / Onboarding & Trials (High Level)
- Prerequisites:
  - Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
  - Cyren Threat Intelligence subscription/API access.
- Install steps:
  1. From Content Hub, install “Cyren Threat Intelligence”.
  2. Configure the Cyren data connector with API keys/endpoint and select the Sentinel workspace.
  3. Deploy recommended analytic rules and the Cyren Threat Intelligence Dashboard workbook.
- Trial approach:
  - Start with a lower polling frequency and a small subset of feeds.
  - Use the workbook to verify data freshness and coverage before fully operationalizing.


3. TacitRed IOC Automation for CrowdStrike Falcon
------------------------------------------------

Full Name + Platform Support
- Integration name: TacitRed IOC Automation for CrowdStrike Falcon
- Supported platforms:
  - TacitRed threat intelligence platform
  - CrowdStrike Falcon (IOC management APIs enabled)

What the Integration Does / Problem It Solves
- Automatically pushes high‑confidence IOCs from TacitRed into CrowdStrike Falcon as detection/prevention indicators.
- Solves the “last mile” problem: turning TacitRed intel into enforced blocking and detections in Falcon without manual IOC upload.

Screenshots / Visual Examples (Suggested)
- Example TacitRed detection that generates IOCs.
- CrowdStrike IOC management or indicators page showing TacitRed‑origin IOCs.
- Simple flow diagram: TacitRed → automation playbook → CrowdStrike Falcon IOC store.

Customer Benefits / Primary Use Cases
- Faster protection: New TacitRed indicators are automatically enforced in Falcon, reducing dwell time.
- Operational efficiency: Avoid manual CSV uploads or hand‑curated IOC lists.
- Consistent policy: Ensure all endpoints covered by Falcon benefit from TacitRed intelligence.
- Design‑partner ready: Ideal for customers who want to trial TacitRed intel in their existing Falcon estate.

Key Features / Value Points
- Automated IOC lifecycle: Create/update IOCs in CrowdStrike based on TacitRed findings.
- Filtering logic: Ability to send only high‑confidence or selected‑severity indicators into Falcon.
- Field mapping: Maps TacitRed fields (type, value, description, severity) to CrowdStrike IOC schema.
- Auditable: Activity visible both in TacitRed and CrowdStrike IOC views.

Installation / Onboarding & Trials (High Level)
- Prerequisites:
  - TacitRed account with access to findings/indicators.
  - CrowdStrike Falcon tenant with API client/secret and IOC permissions.
