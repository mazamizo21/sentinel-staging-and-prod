**"CCF is new and unproven"**
> "CCF is Microsoft's latest framework for native Sentinel integrations. Our Enhanced CCF builds on Microsoft's platform with enterprise features: comprehensive documentation, extensive sample queries, health monitoring, and professional branding. It's the same reliable data collection, just with a better user experience."

**"Price seems high"**
> "Let's look at ROI: Manual threat intelligence processes cost $104K annually. Our solution automates 60% of that work, saving $62K per year. That's 780% ROI in year one. Plus, faster threat detection reduces breach risk - a single prevented breach pays for the solution 100x over."
